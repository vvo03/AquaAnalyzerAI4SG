<h1>What is Aqua Analyzer?</h1>
<p>Aqua Analyzer is a web app that helps residents understand how water affects their daily life, the source of their local water, and what effects it may have on their health.

<h1>What do we have to offer?</h1>
  We used monthly water quality reports from Valley Water to collect information and provide accurate data for residents to understand what happens at the water treatment plants. We also use generative AI to create generated summaries and images for actionable information that residents can use. </p>
<p>We have three features that focus on educating local residents about our water sources(treatment plants), learn what pH is and why it is important for them, and to understand certain consequences, steps to take, and how pH and minerals may impact their water quality.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Valley water report summarization - Grabs important data from the report and breaks it into two categories: concerns and recommendations.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Recommendations can help residents understand where things can be improve from an person that works with the water industry</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Water pH tool - Helps residents understand the pH scale's levels, how water is measured with examples of differing pH materials.</li>
  <li>Water educator - Teaches residents on health benefits and mineral effects on the body.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Our solution?</h1>
<p>We decided to create a website that is more interactive than a chatbox because we would want people to engage with the website. We also want to close the gap with people not being informed about water and how water can positively or negatively affect our health.</p>
